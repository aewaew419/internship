This is a placeholder for the Excel file. In a real implementation, you would create an actual Excel file with the following structure:

Column A: full_name
Column B: email  
Column C: password

Row 1 (Header): full_name | email | password
Row 2: John Doe | john.doe@example.com | password123
Row 3: Jane Smith | jane.smith@example.com | password456
Row 4: Bob Johnson | bob.johnson@example.com | password789

To create this file, you can use Excel or any spreadsheet application and save it as .xlsx format.
