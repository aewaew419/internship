# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive internship approval status tracking system that manages the approval workflow from initial student application through final approval or rejection. The system tracks multiple approval stages including advisor approval, committee approval, and handles various status transitions with proper API integration to ensure real-time status updates and accurate document state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see the current status of my internship application, so that I can track the approval progress and know what actions are needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student submits an internship application THEN the system SHALL display status as "อยู่ระหว่างการพิจารณา โดยอาจารย์ที่ปรึกษา" with status code "registered"
2. WHEN the advisor approves the application THEN the system SHALL update status to "อยู่ระหว่างการพิจารณา โดยคณะกรรมการ" with status code "t.approved"
3. WHEN all committee members approve THEN the system SHALL display "อนุมัติเอกสารขอฝึกงาน / สหกิจ" with status code "c.approved"
4. WHEN approval is insufficient (less than 50% committee approval or advisor rejection) THEN the system SHALL show "ไม่อนุมัติเอกสารขอฝึกงาน/สหกิจ" with status code "doc.approved"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an advisor, I want to approve or reject student internship applications, so that I can control the quality and appropriateness of internship placements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an advisor accesses pending applications THEN the system SHALL display all applications with "registered" status assigned to them
2. WHEN an advisor approves an application THEN the system SHALL update the status to "t.approved" and notify the committee
3. WHEN an advisor rejects an application THEN the system SHALL update the status to "doc.approved" (rejected) and notify the student
4. IF an advisor approval is revoked THEN the system SHALL handle status rollback appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a committee member, I want to review and vote on internship applications that have advisor approval, so that I can participate in the institutional approval process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN committee members access applications THEN the system SHALL show only applications with "t.approved" status
2. WHEN a committee member votes THEN the system SHALL record the vote and calculate approval percentage
3. WHEN committee approval reaches 50% or more THEN the system SHALL automatically update status to "c.approved"
4. WHEN committee approval is less than 50% THEN the system SHALL update status to "doc.approved" (rejected)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage internship status cancellations and handle special cases, so that I can maintain data integrity and handle exceptional situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an approved internship needs cancellation THEN the system SHALL update status to "ยกเลิกการฝึกงาน/สหกิจ" with status code "doc.cancel"
2. WHEN internship completion status is recorded THEN the system SHALL track "Pass/Failed" outcome
3. WHEN status changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of all status transitions
4. IF data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide correction mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the status display to match exactly with the UI design specifications, so that the user interface remains consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying status messages THEN the system SHALL use exact Thai text as specified in requirements
2. WHEN showing status indicators THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors and icons matching the UI design
3. WHEN status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately without page refresh
4. IF the UI design changes THEN the system SHALL be easily configurable to match new specifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust API integration for status management, so that the system can handle concurrent users and maintain data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent status updates without conflicts
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and show appropriate error messages
3. WHEN status data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and handle malformed responses
4. IF network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide offline status indicators and sync when reconnected
