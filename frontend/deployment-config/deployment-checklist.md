# Notification System Deployment Checklist

## Pre-deployment Setup

### 1. VAPID Keys Configuration
- [ ] Generate proper VAPID keys using web-push library
- [ ] Replace placeholder keys in .env.local
- [ ] Set VAPID_SUBJECT to your domain email
- [ ] Verify keys are properly base64url encoded

### 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] Set NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY in production environment
- [ ] Set VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY securely (not in client-side code)
- [ ] Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_NOTIFICATION_API_URL
- [ ] Set appropriate cache TTL values

### 3. Service Worker
- [ ] Verify service worker is properly built and accessible at /sw.js
- [ ] Test push notification handlers
- [ ] Verify background sync functionality
- [ ] Test offline notification storage

### 4. PWA Manifest
- [ ] Verify manifest.json includes notification permissions
- [ ] Test PWA installation on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify notification icons are properly sized and accessible

## Backend Integration

### 5. API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement /api/notifications endpoints
- [ ] Set up push notification sending service
- [ ] Configure WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
- [ ] Implement notification analytics endpoints

### 6. Database
- [ ] Create notification tables/collections
- [ ] Set up device token storage
- [ ] Implement notification settings storage
- [ ] Configure notification history retention

### 7. Security
- [ ] Implement proper authentication for notification endpoints
- [ ] Set up CORS policies for notification requests
- [ ] Validate push subscription data
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for notification APIs

## Infrastructure

### 8. Server Configuration
- [ ] Configure nginx/Apache for service worker caching
- [ ] Set up proper HTTPS (required for push notifications)
- [ ] Configure WebSocket proxy if using real-time updates
- [ ] Set up monitoring for notification delivery

### 9. CDN and Caching
- [ ] Configure CDN to not cache service worker
- [ ] Set appropriate cache headers for notification assets
- [ ] Configure cache invalidation for notification updates

### 10. Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Set up notification delivery monitoring
- [ ] Configure error tracking for push notifications
- [ ] Implement notification engagement analytics
- [ ] Set up alerts for notification failures

## Testing

### 11. Functional Testing
- [ ] Test push notification delivery on different browsers
- [ ] Test offline notification functionality
- [ ] Verify notification actions work correctly
- [ ] Test notification settings synchronization

### 12. Cross-browser Testing
- [ ] Test on Chrome/Edge (full support)
- [ ] Test on Firefox (limited support)
- [ ] Test on Safari (where supported)
- [ ] Test fallback behavior on unsupported browsers

### 13. Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test PWA notifications on Android
- [ ] Test web notifications on iOS Safari
- [ ] Verify touch-optimized notification interactions
- [ ] Test notification bar on mobile devices

### 14. Performance Testing
- [ ] Test notification system under load
- [ ] Verify service worker performance
- [ ] Test offline storage limits
- [ ] Monitor notification delivery latency

## Post-deployment

### 15. Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor notification delivery rates
- [ ] Track user engagement with notifications
- [ ] Monitor service worker update cycles
- [ ] Track offline functionality usage

### 16. User Education
- [ ] Provide clear notification permission requests
- [ ] Document notification settings for users
- [ ] Create help documentation for notification features
- [ ] Monitor user feedback on notification experience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Service worker not updating: Check cache headers and versioning
- Push notifications not received: Verify VAPID keys and subscription
- Offline functionality not working: Check IndexedDB and cache implementation
- High battery usage: Review background sync frequency and optimization

### Debug Tools
- Chrome DevTools Application tab for service worker debugging
- Firefox Developer Tools for push notification testing
- Browser console for notification API errors
- Network tab for API request monitoring

## Security Considerations

### 17. Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive notification data
- [ ] Implement proper data retention policies
- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance for notification data
- [ ] Secure device token storage

### 18. Privacy
- [ ] Implement clear notification consent mechanisms
- [ ] Allow users to control notification types
- [ ] Provide easy unsubscribe options
- [ ] Respect user privacy preferences

## Performance Optimization

### 19. Optimization
- [ ] Implement notification batching for efficiency
- [ ] Optimize service worker cache strategies
- [ ] Use efficient data structures for notification storage
- [ ] Implement intelligent background sync scheduling

### 20. Scalability
- [ ] Plan for notification volume scaling
- [ ] Implement notification queue management
- [ ] Consider notification service clustering
- [ ] Plan for database scaling with notification growth
