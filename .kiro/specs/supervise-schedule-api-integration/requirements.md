# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue in the supervision schedule system where appointment pages and supervision result reports are not properly pulling data to help with API integration verification. The system currently lacks proper data retrieval mechanisms for supervision appointments and their associated reports, making it difficult to verify API integrations and ensure data consistency across the supervision workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a supervisor, I want the appointment pages to properly pull and display supervision schedule data, so that I can view accurate appointment information and verify system integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a supervisor accesses the appointment page THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all scheduled supervision appointments from the API
2. WHEN appointment data is loaded THEN the system SHALL show appointment details including date, time, student information, and status
3. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and retry mechanism
4. WHEN appointment data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and completeness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a supervisor, I want supervision result reports to pull comprehensive data from the API, so that I can generate accurate reports and verify the supervision process completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating supervision result reports THEN the system SHALL retrieve all relevant supervision data including appointments, evaluations, and outcomes
2. WHEN report data is compiled THEN the system SHALL include supervision session details, student progress, and evaluation results
3. IF supervision data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL identify missing information and provide clear indicators
4. WHEN report generation is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all required data fields are populated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API integration verification tools built into the supervision schedule system, so that I can monitor data flow and identify integration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made for supervision data THEN the system SHALL log request and response details for verification
2. WHEN data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide diagnostic information
3. IF API integration fails THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms and error recovery procedures
4. WHEN supervision data is processed THEN the system SHALL perform data validation checks against expected schemas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and data validation in the supervision schedule API integration, so that the system can gracefully handle failures and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests timeout or fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN invalid data is received from the API THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate data before processing
3. IF critical supervision data is missing THEN the system SHALL prevent incomplete operations and notify relevant users
4. WHEN data synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency between frontend display and backend storage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the supervision system, I want real-time data updates in appointment pages and reports, so that I always see the most current supervision information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN supervision data changes THEN the appointment pages SHALL automatically refresh to show updated information
2. WHEN new supervision appointments are created THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in all relevant views
3. IF real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL provide manual refresh options and indicate data staleness
4. WHEN multiple users access supervision data simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access without data corruption
