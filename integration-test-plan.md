# 🧪 Integration Test Plan - Frontend & Backend

## 📋 Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive integration testing strategy for the Internship Management System, testing the connection between the Next.js frontend and Go Fiber backend.

## 🎯 Test Objectives
- ✅ Verify API connectivity between frontend and backend
- ✅ Test authentication flow end-to-end
- ✅ Validate data flow for all major features
- ✅ Test error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Verify mobile responsiveness with API calls
- ✅ Test real-time notifications integration

## 🔧 Test Environment Setup

### Backend Configuration
